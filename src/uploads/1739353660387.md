# exp-cli

A CLI tool to track your monthly/yearly finance and keep an eye on your expenses.
This project is one of from the [back-end projects on roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker) that me and my collaborator [ME-Atish](https://github.com/ME-Atish) made.
You can find other node.js projects of mine in [this repository](https://github.com/LittleOddBoy/nodejs-roadmapsh-projs).

# Setup 
If you want to set up this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Download the project or simply clone the project via Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LittleOddBoy/nodejs-roadmapsh-projs.git
```

Install the dependencies via npm:
```bash
npm install
```

Install the CLI:
```bash
npm install -g
```

Now, you're all done! Run the program to see the help for it:
```bash
exp
```

# Features
Run the `exp` command to see full feature documentation for all the commands you can run, and if you need help for any of them, let's say `exp add`, you run that command followed by `--help`:
```bash
exp add --help
```
